## Design Concepts

### Self-hosted

Chat Solution is designed to be self-hosted, giving you full control over your data and interactions. This means you can deploy the application on your own servers, ensuring that your conversations and data remain private and secure.

### Privacy First

Privacy is at the heart of Chat Solution. We understand the importance of protecting your data and interactions. By self-hosting, you can ensure that your data is not shared with third parties, providing a secure and private environment for your conversations.

## Customizability

While we're continuously working on expanding the customization options, Chat Solution v0.1.1 offers a basic level of customization:

- **Markdown Responses**: You can choose whether to enable or disable markdown formatting in the responses. This allows for a more readable and structured conversation.

## Future Updates

We're excited to share our roadmap for future updates, which will significantly enhance the functionality and user experience of Chat Solution:

- ### Audio Transcription Capabilities

In the near future, we plan to introduce audio transcription capabilities. This feature will allow users to interact with the chatbot using voice commands, making the application more accessible and convenient.

- ### Access to the Web

We're working on a feature that will enable Chat Solution to access the web. This will open up a wide range of possibilities, including the ability to fetch real-time information, perform web searches, and more, directly within the chat interface.

- ### File Context

To further enhance the user experience, we're planning to introduce a file context feature. This will allow users to upload files or documents and have the chatbot process them, providing more dynamic and interactive conversations.
